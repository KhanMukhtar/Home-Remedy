                            <p><b>*   Iyengar Yoga</b> named after and developed by B. K. S. Iyengar, is a form of Hatha Yoga that has an emphasis on detail, precision and alignment in the performance of posture (asana) and breath control (pranayama).
                                 The development of strength, mobility and stability is gained through the asanas.<br />
                               <b>*</b> Iyengar is a meticulous style of yoga, giving emphasis to proper form in a yoga pose. An Iyengar class will usually provide an array of yoga props – blocks, straps, bolsters, blankets, etc. – to help each student find proper alignment.<br />
                                 <b>*</b> is also usually taught without music and at a slower pace to help students get deeper into the postures and hold them for longer. <br />
                                <b>*</b>This style of yoga is best for those with an injury or chronic condition, as Iyengar teachers must undergo comprehensive training to provide knowledgeable instruction.
                                <b>*What is the purpose of Iyengar yoga?</b><br />
                                The purpose of Iyengar Yoga is to increase health. It is strictly alignment-based and instructors focus on getting the pose just right.
                                 Iyengar is famous for its use of props, including straps, blankets, bolsters, blocks, and chairs, sometimes several at a time.
